# Overview

A small static personal blog and CV style site, deployed to GitHub pages since that makes it relatively easy.

Currently, it is built using the [Statiq Web](https://www.statiq.dev/web) framework and the [CleanBlog theme](https://github.com/statiqdev/CleanBlog).

At present, this is pretty much the bare minimum to get a site up.  In theory I plan to expand upon it further, but we'll see how that goes...
