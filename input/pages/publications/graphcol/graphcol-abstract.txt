This paper first presents a simulation of the simple kernel P systems solution to the graph 3-colouring problem presented in a previous paper by Gheorghe et al., implemented in a programming style named Concurrent ML, which is based on the concept of synchronous communication between logical processing elements. This paper then presents and informally analy- ses an alternative compact single-cell solution to the same problem using P systems with compound objects (cP systems), which has the benefit of naturally adapting to the use of any number of colours greater than zeroâ€”only the specified colour symbols need to be changed. Successful and failing examples of the latter solution are also presented.
