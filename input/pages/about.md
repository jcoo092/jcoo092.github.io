Title: About Me
Description: A Brief History of Mine
---

My name is James Cooper, and (these days) I think of myself as a security-interested software developer.  Sadly, I am presently between jobs at the moment (so if you have one you think I would be good for, please get in touch!).  My most recent role was as a Security Developer (i.e. a software developer with a focus on security) at a small company named [Cosive](https://www.cosive.com/). I am hoping to get another role in software development, preferably with a strong element of application security chucked in for good measure.  Even better if I can somehow work with researchers of some sort too.  I mean, a role as a research software engineer with a leaning towards appsec sounds pretty good to me.

I also have a reasonably significant academic background.  I hold a PhD in Computer Science, and Honours degrees in Commerce and Science, covering Accounting, Commercial Law, Computer Science and Logic & Computation (which for me was basically more CompSci...).  All of these degrees are from the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/) in New Zealand.  I also have [published some papers](publications) in Computer Science, and one in Commercial Law back years ago (adapted from my ComLaw Honours dissertation).  My doctoral dissertation ended up in being primarily in the area of [Membrane Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_computing) (also known as P Systems), though that hadn't been my intention at the start.  Besides Membrane Computing and Application Security, I also have a keen interest in Programming Languages and Computer Vision (though, to be frank, I'm not particularly strong in the latter).

Just in case you're curious, these days I mostly spend my time working at paid employment (or, while unemployed, some personal projects I'm tinkering with), or reading computer science/programming/software development textbooks.[^1]  To prove I'm not *completely* boring, I used to be fairly heavily involved with [NZLARPS](https://nzlarps.org/), but have been too caught up in doctoral studies in the past few years.  I do still attend a weekly tabletop roleplaying game, thanks to the [Auckland Roleplaying Guild](https://aucklandrpg.nz/).  Wait, that might not be proof non-boring-ness...

[^1]: One day I *might* get around to putting up a listing of what I have read, and probably include brief reviews also.
