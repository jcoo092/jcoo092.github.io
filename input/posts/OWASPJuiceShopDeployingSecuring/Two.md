# Deploying the Juice Shop to AWS, the manual way

## Summary

A short overview/walkthrough of how I deployed the [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/) web application to AWS, taking the simplistic and na√Øve approach.  Roughly speaking, this will use the Infrastructure-as-a-Service approach, with the deployment performed via the AWS management console in a point & click fashion.  I haven't yet figured out any details beyond that, though.



[^SaaSBOM]: Apparently there are also now things like a [SaaSBOM](https://owasp.org/blog/2023/06/23/CycloneDX-v1.5.html), too.
