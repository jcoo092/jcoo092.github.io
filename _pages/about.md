These days, I am a doctoral student at the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/) in New Zealand, with the [School of Computer Science](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/school-of-computer-science.html).  I am due to finish and submit my final dissertation at the end of September 2021, however, and so am now actively seeking full-time employment from October 2021.  For the time being, for various reasons, I am looking for a job in industry as a software developer.  I hope to return to research full-time as a post-doc or industrial researcher in the near-ish future, however.

I also happen to have a degree in Accounting & Commercial Law from back in the day.  Specifically, I hold a conjoint BCom/BSc from the University of Auckland, with majors in Accounting, Commercial Law and Computer Science, along with a Specialisation in Logic & Computation (which was effectively a fourth major).  I further hold a BCom(Hons) in Commercial Law, and a BSc(Hons) in Computer Science.  In fact, I actually published an article in the Commercial Law journal New Zealand Business Law Quarterly some years ago as an outcome of my Commercial Law Honours year.

Just in case you're curious, these days I mostly spend my time working on my PhD in some capacity, or reading computer science/programming/software development textbooks.[^1]  To prove I'm not *completely* boring, I used to be fairly heavily involved with [NZLARPS](https://nzlarps.org/), but have been too caught up in doctoral studies in the past few years.  I do still attend a weekly tabletop roleplaying game, thanks to the [Auckland Roleplaying Guild](https://aucklandrpg.nz/).

[^1]: One day I will get around to putting up a listing of what I have read, and probably include brief reviews also.
