# I Have A Problem With Design Patterns

Just in case the title and heading didn't tip you off, I have a problem with software design patterns.  The problem isn't actually with the design patterns themselves, nor (necessarily) with the people who promote them.  My problem, at it's root, is how people treat them with an unquestioning semi-religious idolatry, and also use them as a way to declare themselves superior to others in a most idiotic fashion.

## Not Alexander's Pattern Languages

Before I go any further, I just want to point out (in case there's any confusion), I am _not_ talking about the design patterns as discussed by Christoper Alexander in his book 'A Pattern Language'.  At SPLASH 2022, there was an interesting keynote talk from a Japanese professor (whose name I have completely forgotten now...) discussing that field.  At the start of his talk, he asked who in the audience knew about design patterns.  I put my hand up, mistakenly thinking he was discussing software design patterns.  No, turns out he was discussing something older, and probably more meaningful.  Anyway, the point is that I'm vaguely aware of this other use of the term, but I am not talking about it here.  Rather, I'm talking about design patterns as usually known in software development, with names such as the Visitor, Mediator or Observer pattern.
