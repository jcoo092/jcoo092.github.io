# Curriculum Vitae

This page serves as a space-unbounded reference for details potentially relevant to someone considering recruiting me for a job.  This is intended to be a somewhat-complete listing of everything that someone could be interested in, going beyond what I would normally submit as my CV to any normal job application.  There will be, of course, things that I don't post here (e.g. the job as a kitchen hand I had back when I was in high school) because I don't think they could possibly be relevant to anybody anymore, and some things I just forget to mention.  Plus, I don't want to doxx myself completely.

The below sections are ordered **alphabetically**, since different parts will be more or less relevant to different people.  Subsections may be ordered alphabetically, or with another system where appropriate.  For example, my formal education and work experience are listed in reverse chronological order.

## Education

### Certifications

None as yet, but I very much hope to earn some in my next job, whatever that may be. 

### Formal Education

#### Doctor of Philosophy[^phd]

University of Auckland

2017-2021

In Computer Science

#### Bachelor of Science (Honours)[^honours]

University of Auckland

2016

In Computer Science

Awarded first class honours.

#### Bachelor of Commerce (Honours)

University of Auckland

2011

In Commercial Law

#### Bachelor of Commerce/Bachelor of Science (conjoint)

University of Auckland
2005-2010
Majors in Accounting, Commercial Law and Computer Science.
Also includes a specialisation in Logic & Computation, which was effectively the same as a fourth major.

[^phd]:  Since I seem to keep encountering confusion about this, "Doctor of Philosophy" is the official title of the degree, in the same way that Bachelor of Arts is the official title for an undergraduate degree in English.  It does _not_ (necessarily) mean that someone has studied or researched philosophy specifically—for example, mine was wholly dedicated to Computer Science.  I believe the "philosophy" part is a historical artifact, from back when a lot of different studies tended to be referred to as some sort of philosophy.  I'm not totally sure on why PhDs have become the norm for all doctorates, but they seem to have.
[^honours]:  At the University of Auckland, the Honours degree (for most undergraduate degrees) is considered the first level of postgraduate qualification, and is loosely equivalent to the first year of a two-year Masters program.  For most faculties, it is _not_ equivalent to North American undergraduate honours systems (though I think in the case of Law and Engineering, it roughly is—go figure).

### Programming Languages

#### Programming Languages - Used

These are all programming languages with which I have done something non-trivial.  It doesn't include absolutely every language I have ever interacted with, since that would also include all the ones where I never really got past the Hello World stage, and research languages that have never been used for non-research purposes.  I have not _yet_ classified them further according to my experience level with them.  Plus, I haven't used some of them for quite a while.  They are presented in alphabetical order, but the list is probably incomplete since I might well forget about some languages I haven't used in some time.  Also, just because something doesn't appear here, it doesn't mean that I have no interest in it, I just haven't ever had occasion to do something noteworthy with it.

- Assembly
  - Alpha
  - LC-3
- Bash
- C
- C++
- C#
- Erlang
- F#
- Go (golang)
- Java
- Javascript
- Powershell
- Python
- Racket
- Rust
- Scala 2
- Standard ML (Mlton)
- Swift
- Visual Basic .NET

#### Programming Languages - Touched

These are programming languages which I have touched on (i.e., _at least_ done Hello World and similar) in the past, but which I don't consider myself to have done anything truly non-trivial with.  I could probably pick them up faster than someone who has never used them, but I wouldn't claim that I could possibly expect to start contributing to a codebase in one of these languages without first improving my skills further.  I would gladly do so, given the chance.  Again, they are presented in alphabetical order.

- CIL/MSIL
- Clojure
- Fortran
- Guile Scheme
- Haskell
- Julia
- OCaml
- PHP
- Prolog
- Ruby
- SQL[^sql]

[^sql]: While I certainly consider myself to understand the fundamental concepts of SQL, e.g. joins, I have mostly been able to get away with using ORMs and the like.  Thus, I haven't done all that much writing of SQL _directly_ by hand.  This is not to say that I think I have no idea how to work with a database.

#### Programming Languages - Interested
