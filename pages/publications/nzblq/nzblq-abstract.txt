Direct enforcement of security in personal property by creditors is primarily governed in New Zealand by three statutes, depending on the details of the security: the Personal Property Securities Act 1999, the Property Law Act 2007 and the Credit (Repossession) Act 1997. These statutes do not always fit together neatly, arguably without benefit, and this article will critique some of the differences between the statutes, and suggest some possible improvements that could be made. Some familiarity with the three Acts is assumed.
