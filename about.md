These days, I am a doctoral student at the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/) in New Zealand, with the [School of Computer Science](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/school-of-computer-science.html).  I am due to finish and submit my final dissertation at the end of September 2021, however, and so am now actively seeking full-time employment from October 2021.

I also happen to have a degree in Accounting & Commercial Law, from back in the day.  Specifically, I hold a conjoint BCom/BSc from the University of Auckland, with majors in Accounting, Commercial Law and Computer Science, along with a Specialisation in Logic & Computation (which was effectively a fourth major).  I further hold a BCom(Hons) in Commercial Law, and a BSc(Hons) in Computer Science.  In fact, I actually published an article in the Commercial Law journal New Zealand Business Law Quarterly some years ago as an outcome of my Commercial Law Honours year.
